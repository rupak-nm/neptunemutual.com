      Decentralized Insurance Protocol for Ethereum
    </h1>
    <p class="sub title">
      Neptune Mutual is the first parametric insurance protocol created for
      Ethereum. Unlike other protocols, it makes no difference if one user or
      one million users are filing claims at the same time; we are already
      scalable.
    </p>
    <p class="sub title">
      Launch the app, choose an insurance pool, and enter your coverage amount.
      Following successful incident resolution, <strong
        >collect stablecoin payouts immediately</strong
      >. No need to provide personally identifiable information, loss evidence,
      or wait for a verdict. No need to spend valuable gas evaluating on each
      claim. No discrimination--everyone is treated equally.
